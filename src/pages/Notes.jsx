// NOTE : In React, ref is commonly used to get direct access to a DOM element or an instance of a component. However, in our case, we are using ref in a slightly different way. Instead of using ref to store a reference to a DOM node, we are using it to attach a function (lastNoteRef) to a DOM node (the last note). This function is then executed whenever this DOM node’s ref is accessed during rendering.

// The useCallback hook is used here to ensure that the lastNoteRef function doesn’t change on every render. Without useCallback, a new lastNoteRef function would be created on every render, causing unnecessary re-renders of your Note components, as each Note would receive a new ref prop on every render.

// So, in our case, lastNoteRef is a function that’s attached to the ref of the last note. When React sees this, it will call this function with the DOM node as its argument, which allows us to directly observe this DOM node with the Intersection Observer in our lastNoteRef function.

// This is a more advanced use of ref, but it’s perfectly valid and is part of React’s flexibility. It allows us to observe the last note element directly as soon as it’s rendered to the DOM, which is exactly what we need for implementing the infinite scroll feature. So yes, it will work. This pattern is sometimes referred to as “callback refs” in React.
